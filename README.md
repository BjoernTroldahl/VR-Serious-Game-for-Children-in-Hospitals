# VR-Serious-Game-for-Children-in-Hospitals
A school project that I made as part of a 6–person team, over the course of 4 months. 
It is a serious VR game for distracting children in hospitals, made with Unity version 2021.3.17f1 and done in collaboration with Rigshospitalet (The Danish National Hospital). 
Unity VR and the OpenXR module were used for development.

The game is about locating the sound sources of different animals in the environment, using the VR controller. It is designed to distract and calm children during medical needle procedures
and has also been tested on a sample group of 13 participants at Rigshospitalet. 

Version control was originally done with Plastic SCM, but I uploaded the project here on GitHub as well, in order to have more accessible documentation.

## Our roles on the team were as follows:

Freya Gade — lead programmer, R&D

Bjørn Troldahl (me) — assistant programmer, sound designer and QA

Julius Winther — game & level design and shaders

Nickolai Jensen — game & level design and shaders

Maya Bordum — game & level design and QA

Frederik Stappert — project management, R&D and QA

## How to install and use:

To install the prototype, there are two different methods. Either install it with the APK or
build it directly from Unity. These tutorials will mainly be for Meta Quest 2, due to development happening with the Meta Quest 2. Both tutorials assume you have a USB-C cable
which can transfer files from the PC to the Headset.

### To install it through the APK:
1. Install a third-party software to install APK’s to the headset, such as SideQuest.

2. Set up the app following the instructions and install it to the headset.

3. Through the app, transfer the APK to the headset.

4. In the headset, navigate to the "Unknown Sources" tab and launch the app "MED6-Pain-
Distraction".

### To install it through Unity (Recommended):
1. Install the Unity version "2021.3.17f1" with the Android Build Support Module.

2. Import the project into Unity and launch it.

3. Once the project is opened, navigate to the build settings (File → Build Settings or
Ctrl+Shift+B on Windows).

4. Switch the platform to Android.

5. Select the headset under "Run Device".

6. Press "Build and Run", which prompts to save the file locally first.

7. The project will now build, and once it has been built it will run automatically.

8. To re-open the project, navigate to the "Unknown Sources" tab in the headset, and
launch the app "MED6-Pain-Distraction".
