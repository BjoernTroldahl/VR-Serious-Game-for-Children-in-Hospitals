# VR-Serious-Game-for-Children-in-Hospitals
A school project that I made as part of a 6–person team, over the course of 4 months. 
It is a serious VR game about pain distraction for children in hospitals, made with Unity version 2021.3.17f1 and in collaboration with Rigshospitalet (The Danish National Hospital). 
The game is about locating the sound sources of different animals with the VR controller, and is designed for medical procedures in hospitals with children that are afraid of being stung with needles.
Has also been tested on a sample group of 13 participants at Rigshospitalet. 
Version control was originally done with Plastic SCM, but I uploaded the project here on GitHub as well, in order to have more accessible documentation.

## Our roles on the team were as follows:

Freya Gade — lead programmer, R&D

Bjørn Troldahl (me) — assistant programmer, sound designer and QA

Julius Winther — game & level design and shaders

Nickolai Jensen — game & level design and shaders

Maya Bordum — game & level design and QA

Frederik Stappert — project management, R&D and QA
