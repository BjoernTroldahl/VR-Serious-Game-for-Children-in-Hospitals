# VR-Serious-Game-for-Children-in-Hospitals
A school project that I made as part of a 6–person team, over the course of 4 months. 
It is a serious VR game about pain distraction for children in hospitals, made with Unity version 2021.3.17f1 and in collaboration with Rigshospitalet (The Danish National Hospital). 
Version control was originally done with Plastic SCM, but I uploaded the project here on GitHub as well, in order to have more accessible documentation.

## Our roles on the team were as follows:

Freya Gade — lead programmer, R&D

Bjørn Troldahl (me) — assistant programmer, sound designer and QA

Julius Winther — game & level design and shaders

Nickolai Jensen — game & level design and shaders

Maya Bordum — game & level design and QA

Frederik Stappert — project management, R&D and QA
